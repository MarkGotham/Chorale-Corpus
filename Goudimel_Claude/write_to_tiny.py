ABOUT:
===============================
Although this repo works by
storing the VoR in JSON as strings and
creating scores in mxl format from there,
often it's easier to
create some version of the scores in a music notation editor first and
extract at least an initial version of the string representation from there.
These initial scores can be then discarded.
This module helps with that process by writing from score to tiny notation strings.
