# We have moved!

Due to some awesome multi-group collaboration,
your one-stop-shop for chorale corpora is
the fabulous new ['Chorale-corpus' org](https://github.com/chorale-corpus).
There you will find maintained versions of the Goudimel and Bach
(from here)
alongside many other corpora.
Long live open source collaboration!


## This `Chorale-Corpus` repo (archive)

This repo was a starting point for two chorale collections
1. [Bach chorales](./Bach,_Johann_Sebastian/Chorales)
2. [Goudimel](./Goudimel_Claude/Pseaumes/)

As I say, head over to the org for the latest.
The corresponding links are:
1. [Bach](https://github.com/Chorale-Corpus/Bach_JS)
2. [Goudimel](https://github.com/Chorale-Corpus/Goudimel_C)
