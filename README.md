# Chorale-Corpus

This is a Corpus of Chorale Collections, from teh sixteenth to eighteenth century
and including but extending far beyond those of J. S. Bach:
1. [371 Bach chorales](./Bach,_Johann_Sebastian/Chorales)
2. The [Geneva Psalter with harmonisations by Claude Goudimel](./Goudimel_Claude/Pseaumes/)
3. More to follow soon ... 

We provide
- all scores in the maximally interoperable “musicXML” format which can be opened in any
  notation software (MuseScore, Sibelius, Finale, … ).
- complete transparency over the sources used and conversion routines (including code).

Code is currently corpus-specific and hosted within-corpus. This may change.

We're in the process of making a much larger, multi-group, multi-composer collection 
of chorales where this set (Bach, Goudimel, ...) join many others.
It's possible / likely that this repo will re-locate there.
Watch this space!
