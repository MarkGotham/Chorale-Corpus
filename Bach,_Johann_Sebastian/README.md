# Chorale-Corpus: J S Bach

### Transcription and Review Notes

This set was initially transcribed and released by MuseScore user 
[`x_x0_0`](https://musescore.com/user/11015626/sets/5105738) 
who notes the:
- Source: https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/318117/uhuo
- Numbering from the first, 1784 edition.
- Edits to the voicing, making it "more consistent at places where the upper staff contains 
  notes from the tenor voice (either voice 3 or cross-staff beams).
- Proof-reading is by my (paid) research assistants. See notes below. Thanks to all contributors!

### TODO

We will probably un-do the voicing edits, returning the scores to a clear 2-voices per part.
This would then support automatic mapping 
from the 2 staves ("close score") keyboard version 
to 4 stave ("open score") SATB choral setting.

### Error/edits

In proofreading, we found no transcription errors introduced in
this MuseScore transcription that were not present in the Breitkopf source.
(And we pause to acknowledge that achievement.)
However, the source does contain some clear errors, 
some but not all of which are corrected in the transcription.
We have attempted to resolve all such issues in this repository,
by comparing against the original (e.g., cantata) source.
and entering corrections to the MuseScore "source" file, 
which then end up in all the derivative files produced from it.
